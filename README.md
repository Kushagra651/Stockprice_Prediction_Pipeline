ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
ðŸ”¹ Overview

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based deep learning model to predict stock prices using historical time-series data. LSTMs are well-suited for financial forecasting tasks because they capture long-term dependencies and sequential patterns in data.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Collects and preprocesses historical stock price data.

Normalizes time-series for better training performance.

Builds an LSTM neural network for stock price prediction.

Visualizes predicted vs. actual stock prices.

Modular and extensible for other stocks or assets.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Python 3.x

Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

Data Source: Yahoo Finance API / CSV historical data

ðŸ”¹ Project Workflow

Data Collection â€“ Load stock price data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).

Preprocessing â€“ Handle missing values, scaling, and train-test split.

Model Building â€“ Design an LSTM architecture with stacked layers.

Training â€“ Optimize using Adam optimizer & MSE loss.

Evaluation â€“ Compare predictions with ground truth using RMSE.

Visualization â€“ Plot actual vs. predicted prices.

ðŸ”¹ Results

LSTM effectively captures stock price trends.

Model performance depends on hyperparameters (timesteps, epochs, learning rate) and data quality.

Predicted curves align well with actual stock prices, though not perfect (markets are noisy!).

ðŸ”¹ How to Run

# Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction

# Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the notebook or script

python stock_prediction_lstm.py

ðŸ”¹ Future Improvements

Add more features (technical indicators, macroeconomic data).

Experiment with GRU/Transformer-based models.

Deploy as a Streamlit web app for interactive predictions.
